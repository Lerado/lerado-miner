Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade&#10;      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,&#10;      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the&#10;      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.&#10;&#10;   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or&#10;      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each&#10;      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,&#10;      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or&#10;      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions&#10;      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A&#10;      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,&#10;      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,&#10;      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly&#10;      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be&#10;      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,&#10;      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a&#10;      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the&#10;      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,&#10;      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all&#10;      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor&#10;      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&#10;&#10;   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing&#10;      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,&#10;      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&#10;      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&#10;      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only&#10;      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf&#10;      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,&#10;      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability&#10;      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason&#10;      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&#10;&#10;   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#10;&#10;   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.&#10;&#10;      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following&#10;      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets &quot;[]&quot;&#10;      replaced with your own identifying information.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM&#10;    CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#10;&#10;    1. DEFINITIONS&#10;&#10;    &quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#10;&#10;    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation&#10;       distributed under this Agreement, and&#10;    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#10;    i) changes to the Program, and&#10;    ii) additions to the Program;&#10;    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are &#10;    distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from&#10;    a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or&#10;    anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include&#10;    additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software&#10;    distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,&#10;    and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are&#10;    necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when&#10;    combined with the Program.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,&#10;    including all Contributors.&#10;&#10;    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#10;&#10;    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants&#10;       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to&#10;       reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly&#10;       perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,&#10;       if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.&#10;    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants&#10;       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under&#10;       Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise&#10;       transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code&#10;       and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination&#10;       of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is&#10;       added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such&#10;       combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license&#10;       shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.&#10;       No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#10;    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses&#10;       to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any&#10;       Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other&#10;       intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor&#10;       disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other&#10;       entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or&#10;       otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted&#10;       hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure&#10;       any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if&#10;       a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute&#10;       the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license&#10;       before distributing the Program.&#10;    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient&#10;       copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright&#10;       license set forth in this Agreement.&#10;&#10;    3. REQUIREMENTS&#10;&#10;    A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under&#10;    its own license agreement, provided that:&#10;&#10;    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#10;    b) its license agreement:&#10;    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and&#10;       conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of&#10;       title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of&#10;       merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#10;    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for&#10;       damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and&#10;       consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#10;    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are&#10;       offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#10;    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such&#10;       Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable&#10;       manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#10;&#10;    When the Program is made available in source code form:&#10;&#10;    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#10;    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.&#10;       Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained&#10;       within the Program.&#10;&#10;    Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,&#10;    if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify&#10;    the originator of the Contribution.&#10;&#10;    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#10;&#10;    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with&#10;    respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is&#10;    intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor&#10;    who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a&#10;    manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.&#10;    Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product&#10;    offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to&#10;    defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;)&#10;    against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from&#10;    claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against&#10;    the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions&#10;    of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the&#10;    Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section&#10;    do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged&#10;    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified&#10;    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing&#10;    of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and&#10;    cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related&#10;    settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any&#10;    such claim at its own expense.&#10;&#10;    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product&#10;    offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If&#10;    that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers&#10;    warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are&#10;    such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the&#10;    Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other&#10;    Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a&#10;    court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the&#10;    Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.&#10;&#10;    5. NO WARRANTY&#10;&#10;    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON&#10;    AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#10;    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR&#10;    CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A&#10;    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the&#10;    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks&#10;    associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but&#10;    not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with&#10;    applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and&#10;    unavailability or interruption of operations.&#10;&#10;    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#10;&#10;    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY&#10;    CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,&#10;    SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION&#10;    LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN&#10;    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)&#10;    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE&#10;    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#10;    OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#10;&#10;    7. GENERAL&#10;&#10;    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under&#10;    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the&#10;    remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the&#10;    parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent&#10;    necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#10;&#10;    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a&#10;    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself&#10;    (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)&#10;    infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted&#10;    under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.&#10;&#10;    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to&#10;    comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and&#10;    does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming&#10;    aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement&#10;    terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as&#10;    soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this&#10;    Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program&#10;    shall continue and survive.&#10;&#10;    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but&#10;    in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only&#10;    be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the&#10;    right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from&#10;    time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to&#10;    modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement&#10;    Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as&#10;    the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of&#10;    the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number.
